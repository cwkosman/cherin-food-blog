Turn on oven to 500 degrees, middle rack, baking sheet.

Mix flour, baking power, salt, and yogurt in a large mixing bowl until mixture is a a slightly sticky ball of dough. Spread a quarter cup of flour on a cutting board or large, flat surface, place ball of dough and cut in to 4 quarters. Lightly coat the dough with flour and place to the side, ie. back in the bowl. Dough can be kept refrigerated overnight.

Roll out 1 quarter of the dough on the cutting board, adding flour to the working area to keep dough from sticking as needed. Roll out dough evenly to about XX cm/in thickness. While rolling the first XXdough, heat about a tsp of cooking oil (or olive oil) in a cast iron over medium heat. Once dough is rolled out, place into cast-iron and set timer for 4 minutes. 

Roll the second dough ball for the next pizza. 

Flip once the bread has started to brown (3-4 minutes). Set timer again for 3 or 4 minutes, add cheese and other toppings. Once the other side is slightly browned, transfer pizza to baking sheet in oven and cook for about 6 minutes. 

As soon as the first pizza is in the oven, you can get started with the next one, until they are all cooked.

We're both big pizza people, with many fond memories from our childhood. For Chuck, it was all about the monster sized slices of Real New York (Brooklyn) pizza when visiting his cousins or grandparents. The doorbell ringing and the yelling of "pizza's here!" in a Brooklyn accent. Erin's childhood pizza memories are more in tune with late night dinners, ordering Panago after double-header hockey games, and then later getting a slice of Nat's Pizza Fridays at lunchtime in high school. 

Inspiration from Jamie Oliver's '5 Ingredients: quick & easy food' cookbook Aunt Margaret got us for Christmas one year. From following the Egg & Mango Chutney Flatbreads recipe, we learned you could make an easy flatbread with flour and yogurt, a pinch of salt, and just a little bit of olive oil. We then searched the internet for naan recipes for more inspiration. 

Naan pizza quickly became a go-to for a quick and easy lunch or dinner, when neither of us felt like putting much effort into cooking, but also felt guilty ordering in.
