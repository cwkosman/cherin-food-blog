Start by filling a medium to large pot ¾ of the way full with water and place on a burner at high heat. Add about a spoonful of salt to the water, and cover with it’s lid.

While the water boils: smash garlic (4 cloves) with side of knife and remove peel, let sit for about 1 min; peel and finely chop onion; finely grate parmesan. 

While chopping onion, heat olive oil (2 Tbsp.) in a saucepan or large skillet over medium heat. Then add onion and garlic, and cook until they start to brown around the edges. 

Once browned, add tomato paste (4.5 oz can) and red pepper flakes (½ tsp.) and stir until paste evenly coats onion. Continue to cook, stirring often until the paste is deep red and starting to brown on the bottom of the pot. Then add vodka (2 oz) to deglaze pan and stir to incorporate, scraping the bottom of the pot, and reduce heat to low. 

With a measuring cup, scoop about ¼ cup of boiling water from the pot, then add heavy cream (¾ cup) to the measuring cup. This will bring the cream up to temperature but avoid curdling it. Slowly add the warmed cream to the onion mixture, stirring constantly, until a smooth sauce forms. Remove from heat. 

Add pasta (1 lb) to pot of boiling salted water and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (the pasta will soften a little more once it’s added to the sauce). Just before the pasta is cooked, remove about 1 cup of pasta water and reserve. Once the pasta is cooked, transfer the drained noodles into the sauce. 

Add ½ cup of pasta water to mix, stif in, then gradually add half the parmesan cheese, stirring constantly to melt in the cheese. You should have a smooth, glossy sauce that coats each piece of pasta. Season with salt and add more pasta water to thin out the sauce, as needed. 

Serve topped with remaining cheese, drizzled olive oil, and torn basil leaves. Enjoy!
