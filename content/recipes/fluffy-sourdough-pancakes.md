**Overnight Sponge**

Prepare the night before or 12 hours prior to use. 

Remove 1 cup of sourdough starter and combine in large bowl with 2 cups flour, 2 Tbsp sugar, and 2 cups of buttermilk (or 2 cups regular milk plus 2 Tbsp yogurt). Stir until just thoroughly mixed. 

Cover and let rest at a cool temperature for 12 hours, or overnight.

**Pancakes**

Preheat oven to 200 °F.

Mix 2 eggs and 4 Tbsp butter (or 1/4 cup oil), add to overnight sponge. 

Add 3/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp baking soda to mixture. The batter should bubble. 

Place frying pan over medium heat. Pour batter onto pan, let sit until bubbles start appearing in batter, then flip and cook until browned. Remove pancake and repeat until all batter is consumed.

Keep pancakes warm in oven on a baking tray until ready to serve.

**Fruit Compote**

In a saucepan, heat berries and maple syrup (or sugar) over medium high heat. Stirring occasionally.

Top pancakes with fruit compote and serve hot.

These are the most amazing pancakes we have ever had. Their fluffiness makes them the perfect vessel for soaking up maple or fruit syrup, and their slight tanginess from the sourdough makes them delicious in their own right. Thanks King Arthur Baking Company, once again, for providing [excellent inspiration](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-sourdough-waffles-or-pancakes-recipe) for what to do with our sourdough discard.

We tried this with whole wheat flour and the pancakes turned out much denser but nonetheless tasty. The same batter can also be made into waffles which we leave to you to try, dear reader.
