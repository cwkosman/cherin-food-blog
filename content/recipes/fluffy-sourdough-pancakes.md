**Overnight Sponge**

Prepare the night before or 12 hours prior to use. 

Remove 1 cup of sourdough starter and combine in large bowl with 2 cups flour, 2 Tbsp sugar, and 2 cups of buttermilk (or 2 cups regular milk plus 2 Tbsp yogurt). Stir until mixture is consistent. 

Cover and let rest at a cool temperature for 12 hours, or overnight. 

**Pancakes**

Mix 2 eggs and 4 Tbsp butter (or 1/4 cup oil), add to overnight sponge. 

Add 3/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp baking soda to mixture. The batter should bubble. 

Place frying pan over medium heat. Pour batter onto pan, let sit until bubbles start appearing in batter, then flip and cook until browned. 

**Fruit Compote**

In a saucepan, heat berries and maple syrup (or sugar) over medium high heat. Stirring occasionally.

You can keep pancakes warm in oven at 200Â°F while you wait to serve. This same recipe also works for waffles. We tried this with whole wheat flour and the pancakes didn't turn out quite as fluffy, but they were still tasty. 

These are actually the most amazing pancakes we have ever had. They are light, fluffy, and delicious.
