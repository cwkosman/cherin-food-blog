Fill a medium pot with water and add salt to boil on high heat. 

Meanwhile, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in skillet over medium heat. 

Mince garlic, finely chop onion, and chop broccoli to roughly the same size as the pasta. 

Add onion and garlic to skillet and cook, stirring often, for about 5 min. Then add sausage, de-cased and broken up. Cook for 10 min or until meat is just about cooked through.

Once water is boiled, add 250g pasta and set timer. Cook to just al dente.

Add broccoli to skillet mix, stir, cover and let cook on medium-low for another 5 min. Drain pasta and add to skillet. 

Turn off burner, stir in 2 Tbsp of olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper to taste. 

Serve hot!

This meal is the Chuck Special. We always have onion, garlic, olive oil, pasta, greens, and some kind of protein on hand and this simple but effective recipe makes the best of all of them. Whatever the protein, greens, or pasta shape are, they will go happily into this mix. Our favourite is fresh Italian Sausages from our local butcher or vegan sausages from the grocery store, broccoli, and 'little ears' orrechiette pasta. 

You can [make your our own orrechiette](https://www.finecooking.com/article/making-robust-flavorful-orecchiette-pasta) as well, and don't need a pasta maker. Plus, the dough will keep relatively well frozen if you accidentally make too much the first time!
