Fill a medium pot with water and add salt to boil on high heat. 

Meanwhile, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in skillet over medium heat. 

Mince onion and garlic, and chop broccoli roughly the same size as the pasta. 

Add onion and garlic to skillet and cook, stirring often, for about 5 min. Then add sausage, de-cased and broken up, or coarsely chopped. Cook for 10 min or until meat is just about cooked through.

Once water is boiled, add 250 g pasta and set timer. Cook to al dente. 

Add broccoli to skillet mix, stir, cover and let cook on medium-low for another 5 min. 

Once al dente, drain pasta and add to skillet. 

Turn off burner, stir in 2 Tbsp of olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper to taste. 

Serve hot!

This meal is the Chuck Special. Onion, garlic, olive oil, pasta, protein and greens, are staples in our kitchen. Whatever the protein or the greens are, they will go happily into this pasta mix. The favourite, however, is fresh Italian Sausages from our local butcher or vegan sausages from the grocery store and broccoli.
