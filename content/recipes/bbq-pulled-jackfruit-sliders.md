Drain jackfruit, chop off the 'core' portions and discard. 

Add 1 cup root beer and the jackfruit (2 x 20 oz cans) to the pressure cooker. Cover with lid, seal, and set to high pressure for 5 minutes. 

Drain jackfruit and reserve liquid for later. Mash with potato masher until it resembles pulled meat. 

Add BBQ sauce, mix in to jackfruit, and set cooker to saute. Cook for 2-5 minutes. 

Serve on toasted buns, topped with arugula.
