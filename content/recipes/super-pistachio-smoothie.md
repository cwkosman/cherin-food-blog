Yeah, I get that probably no one has some pistachio butter just laying around at home. But here's the why behind this recipe; I got a Vitamix blender and it's the bomb, and I will find any excuse to use it. It really does live up to the hype that every stay-at-home mom recipe blog creates around it. Among other things, it turns out you can throw nuts in it and blend them into nut butter. Nut butter! At home! What a time to be alive.

This one is heavily inspired by a new smoothie recipe from Body Energy Club they're calling "Pistachio Dreaming". Thank you to BEC for the inspiration!
