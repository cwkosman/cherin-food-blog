Preheat oven to 325**Â°**F

Melt 2 Tbsp coconut oil, then mix in 1 cup of sourdough discard until fully combined. 

Sprinkle dried herbs and salt, reserving about half the salt for topping the crackers later. 

Line baking sheet with parchment paper, and spread mixture thinly and evenly onto the baking sheet. Sprinkle the rest of the salt on top. 

Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and score crackers, which will allow easily breaking them into individual pieces after baking. 

Bake for an additional 25 - 45 minutes, or until crackers are slightly browned on top and hardened. Be careful not to over bake.
