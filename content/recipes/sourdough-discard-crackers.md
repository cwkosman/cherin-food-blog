Preheat oven to 325**Â°**F.

Melt 2 Tbsp coconut oil, then mix in 1 cup of sourdough discard until fully combined. 

Sprinkle in dried herbs and salt to the sourdough, reserving about half the salt for topping the crackers later. 

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the dough thinly and evenly onto the baking sheet. Sprinkle the rest of the salt on top. 

Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and score a grid onto the still soft crackers, which will allow easily breaking them into individual pieces after baking. 

Bake for an additional 25 - 45 minutes, or until crackers are slightly browned on top and hardened. Be careful not to over bake.

This one is great if you just don't know what to do with your sourdough for a few weeks and don't want to generate food waste. Plus, you can pretty much put anything on crackers for a quick and tasty snack.

You can also use butter instead of coconut oil.
