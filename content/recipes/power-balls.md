Pre-heat oven to 200Â°F ?? (or is it 350?)

Pit and coarsely chop dates. 

Combine dates, chickpea flour, and water in food processor. Pulse until ingredients are incorporated but not smooth. Mixture should resemble slightly stiff cookie dough. 

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 

Roll ping pong sized balls, coat them by rolling in shredded coconut and place on baking sheet. 

Cook for about 10 minutes, until tops are golden brown. 

Store at room temperature for up to a week.
