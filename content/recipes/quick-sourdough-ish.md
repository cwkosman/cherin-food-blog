Warm 2 cups of water to 115 F. 

In a large bowl, combine warm water with honey (2 tsp), yeast (1 tsp) and salt (1 tsp). Let sit for about 5 minutes until yeast is activated. 

Once yeast is activated, stir in flour (4 cups) and sourdough discard (1/2 to 1 cup). Keep mixing until dough formed, if it's too sticky to work with add more flour sprinkle at a time. 

Knead dough for about 10 minutes. Grease bowl (1 Tbsp olive oil), place dough in and cover for 1 hour. 

Pre-heat oven to 400 F

Once dough has about doubled in size, place on baking tray and shape into desired loaf shape. Let rise another 30 min. 

Once oven is pre-heated, bake for 25 min. 

Turn oven down to 350 F and bake for another 15-20 min.

To make bread denser, try halving the amount of yeast and placing dough in smaller confined container (eg. banana bread tin)
