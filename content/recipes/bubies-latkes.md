Bubie’s Homemade Latkes

Eggs, potatoes, flour, salt, pepper, onion, the most canola oil

Use russet potatoes

Peel potatoes

Using a food processor, (chop) the potatoes and onions until mixture resembles apple sauce with the occasional vegetable slice in it

Strain the water out of the potatoes (don’t need to strain all of it though)

Mix in eggs and flour

Batter should be able to form (soft peaks)

Fry in ½ to 1 finger deep oil on medium

The batter should bubble a bit when you drop it in the pan

Leave frying on one side until bubbles appear on the top ()

Try not to flip more than once

Keep the whole surface of the pan covered with oil at all times (yes we are aware that this is a LOT of oil)

Fry until crispy, golden brown

Leave to cool (and dry off some oil) on of paper towels

Enjoy on their own, with apple sauce, or sour cream (or siracha mayo)
