Cook 1-part pearl or hulled barley to 3 parts stock in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, lower heat to low and simmer, cover and cook until barley is soft and chewy and water is absorbed (at least 25 minutes). 

In a salad bowl, place your kale, torn into your desired size of salad leaves, coarsely grated carrot, and halved grapes. 

Combine all remaining ingredients in bowl, toss, and serve. 

Salads, what's to say about them? They're delicious, nutritious, and customizable. Cooked barley adds a unique chewy texture and nutty flavour. 

You could also mix up the dressing, such as sesame soy sauce or fresh lemon.
