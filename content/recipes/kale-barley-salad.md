Bring vegetable stock to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Add barley and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook until barley is soft and chewy and stock is absorbed (at least 25 minutes). 

In a salad bowl, place your kale, torn into your desired size of salad leaves, coarsely grated carrot, halved grapes, almonds, and sunflower seeds. Whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper. Top salad with dressing, toss, and serve immediately.

Salads are easy and infinitely customizable. Cooked barley adds a chewy texture and nutty flavour. Oil and vinegar makes for a classic dressing, but a sesame oil with soy sauce dressing or even just fresh lemon juice pair well, too.
