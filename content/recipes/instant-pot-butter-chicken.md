Add coconut oil to instant pot and set to 'saute'. Add minced fresh ginger, garlic, and bell pepper. Cook for about 2-3 minutes. 

Add spices (curry powder, garam masala, cumin, salt, ground ginger, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper), sugar, tomato sauce, broth, and textured vegetable protein. Close and seal instant pot. Cook on 'manual' for 10 minutes. 

Once the time is up, use quick release to depressurize the instant pot. Carefully open the lid and add the balsamic vinegar and soy sauce. Add coconut milk and stir.

Add more salt, pepper, sugar, or cayenne pepper to adjust the flavour. 

Serve topped with fresh herbs, with rice or naan.

One of our favourite comfort food cuisines is Indian food: tender, spicy, and bone-warming. Butter chicken is among our typical dishes to order from local Indian restaurants, shout out to Tandoori Fusion and Raga Restaurant for many a meal.

This recipe is admittedly not traditional Butter Chicken at all, containing neither butter nor chicken. Coconut oil provides the saut√©ing fats while textured vegetable protein (which goes by many names, including "soy" or it's acronym "TVP") is a nutritious, delicious, and ridiculously cost-effective vegan meat substitute. The instant pot coaxes the TVP to quickly absorb the saucy goodness.
