**Potato Filling**

Fill large pot with water and add diced potatoes. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook about 20 minutes or until pieces easily pierced with a fork. 

Drain water and let potatoes cool for 5 minutes. 

Mash potatoes and combine with 1/4 tsp salt, 1 Tbsp butter, and 2 Tbsp cream cheese. 

Cover and set aside until ready to roll. 

**"Meat" Filling**

Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet. Add finely chopped onions and sautee until slightly translucent, then add vegan ground meat and shredded carrot. Cook until slightly browned. 

Set aside and let cool until ready to roll. 

**Pierogi Dough**  

In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer bowl, whisk together warm water (1 cup), milk (1/4 cup), plain yogurt (2 Tbsp), an egg, and salt (1 tsp) until blended. 

Gradually mix in flour, starting with 2 cups, then 1/2 a cup at a time. Knead for about 10 minutes. You should now have a solid round of dough.

**Making them**

Cut dough into 4 equal pieces. 

On a lightly floured surface, roll out a piece of dough. Try to get it about 1/8" thickness, but if it's a little thicker it'll work just fine. 

Use a 3" diameter round cookie cutter, mug, or small bowl to cut circles from the dough. Take the round and place 1/2 Tbsp of filling in the center. Fold one side of the round on to the other, encircling the filling. Tightly pinch together the edges to seal. 

Keep the dough scraps to roll out again and make more rounds. 

Pierogis can be cooked right away or frozen and kept in the freezer for later.

**Cooking them** 

Fill a large pot with water, lightly salted. Bring the water to a boil. Once water is boiling, add pierogis, about 5 at a time, to the water. 

Once pierogis start to float, cook for an additional 3-5 minutes and prepare a lightly oiled skillet for frying the pierogis. 

Fry each dumpling for 3-5 minutes per side, or until slightly browned.
