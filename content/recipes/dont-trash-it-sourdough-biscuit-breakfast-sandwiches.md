**Sourdough Biscuits**

Preheat the oven to 425°F, with a rack in the upper third. Grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.

Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is unevenly crumbly.

Add the starter, mixing gently until the dough is cohesive.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (a piece of parchment works well), and gently pat it into a 6" round about 1"-thick.

**Breakfast Sandwiches**

Heat 1 Tsp olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Add veggies and sauté until tender. 

Spread veggies evenly in the skillet, and crack two eggs on top of vegetables. Try to keep the eggs separate from each other. Add 1 oz of water to pan and cover with lid for 3-4 min, or slightly longer if you don't like runny eggs. 

Meanwhile, slice biscuits in half, place prosciutto on top of one half, and lightly toast. Watch out for too much smoke. 

Once toasted, thinly spread mustard (or other sauce) to the uncovered half of biscuit and top the sandwich with the egg and vegetable mix. 

NOTE: you can easily replace the prosciutto with cheese or vegan option.

Almost every day we'll make breakfast in the morning. 9 times out of 10 that breakfast is some sort of fridge experiment on a bagel or a biscuit. This recipe takes Sustainibbles even one step further.
