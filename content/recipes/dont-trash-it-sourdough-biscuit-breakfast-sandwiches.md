**Sourdough Biscuits**

Preheat the oven to 425°F, with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line it with parchment (or grease).

Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is unevenly crumbly. We recommend using a potato masher.

Add the starter a little at a time, mixing until the dough is cohesive.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (a piece of parchment works well), and gently pat it into a 6" round about 1"-thick.

Use a sharp 2 3/8" biscuit cutter to cut as many rounds, cutting them as close to one another as possible. Gently push and pat the scraps into rectangle and use to dough to cut the remaining biscuits. If you don't have a biscuit cutter, you can use the rim of a large glass or cup. 

Place the biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2" between them, as they'll grow as they bake.

Bake biscuits for 20 to 23 minutes, or until they're golden brown.

Remove the biscuits from the oven, and let sit while you prepare the toppings. 

Biscuits can also be eaten plain, left to cool and stored at room temperature for several days, or sliced and frozen for longer storage.



**Breakfast Sandwiches**

Heat 1 Tsp olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Add veggies and sauté until tender. 

Spread veggies evenly in the skillet, and crack two eggs on top of vegetables. Try to keep the eggs separate from each other. Add 1 oz of water to pan and cover with lid for 3-4 min for soft fried eggs. 

Meanwhile, slice biscuits in half, place prosciutto on top of one half, and lightly toast in a toaster oven. Watch out for too much smoke. 

Once toasted, thinly spread mustard (or other sauce) to the uncovered half of biscuit and top the sandwich with the egg and vegetable mix. 

NOTE: you can easily replace the prosciutto with cheese or vegan option.

Almost every day we'll make breakfast in the morning. 9 times out of 10 that breakfast is some sort of fridge experiment on a bagel or a biscuit.

This year Chuck was gifted a sourdough starter from his two friends. Finally, we joined all the cool kids in the lockdown trend of bread making at home and got that low maintenance pet we've always dreamed of.\

Like a pet, you have to [feed your sourdough starter](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/feeding-and-maintaining-your-sourdough-starter-recipe) regularly by topping it up with flour and water. Doing so fills up your sourdough jar over time, so you have to discard excess that you don't have a home for. However, this discard is useful as a starting point in many savoury baked goods. Bitter greens and prosciutto are a time-tested wining combination.
