In a small saucepan, heat up sugar (3/4 cup) and (optionally) butter (1 Tbsp.) over medium heat, whisking constantly. As sugar starts to melt and change colour (about 3-5 min), add salt (1 Tsp.), and optionally add heavy cream (1/4 cup) to thin out the caramel. 

Set oven rack near center and preheat oven to 325Â°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. 

In a medium bowl, mix together flaked coconut (7/8 cup), caramel, and vanilla extract. 

In a separate bowl, combine eggs (2) and salt. Beat until stiff peaks form. Use a rubber spatula to fold the egg whites into the coconut mixture. 

With two small spoons (ie. one tablespoon and one regular spoon) scoop out a heaping tablespoon. Pack tightly and scoop on to baking tray. Rinse and repeat until the tray is filled, keeping about 1 inch of space in between each unbaked macaroon. 

Bake for 22 minutes, until tops and edges are more golden and lightly crisped, rotating the pan front to back about midway through. This recipe makes 2 trays' worth of macaroons, you can also bake 2 trays simultaneously. Let macaroons cool on wire rack or paper towel. 

If dipping the macaroons in chocolate, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl at medium power, stopping and stirring at 30 second intervals, until just smooth and creamy. (Alternatively, melt the chocolate in a double boiler over simmering water.) Dip the bottoms of the macaroons in the chocolate, scraping excess off with a knife or spatula and back into the bowl, and return to the lined baking sheets. Place the macaroons in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to allow the chocolate to set. 

The macaroons keep well in an airtight container at room temperature for about a week, and can also be frozen and left in the freezer for a few months.

The first time we made macaroons, was as a dessert addition to our family's Passover dinner. After some searching on the internet and cookbooks, Jenn Segal's [Coconut Macaroons recipe](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/coconut-macaroons.html) stuck out to us. We love her easy to follow step-by-step approach and inclusion of very useful photos. We made Jenn's macaroons a handful of times, before experimenting with modifications. 

Macaroons are a great dessert for keeping kosher for Passover and serving after meat meals, with the option to remove the heavy cream while making the caramel. They're also great with coffee in the morning.
