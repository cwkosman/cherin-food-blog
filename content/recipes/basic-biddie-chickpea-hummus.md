**Hummus**

In a food processor or blender, combine chickpeas, lemon juice, crushed garlic cloves, and olive oil. Blend until smooth, adding olive oil as needed. Once smooth and combined, blend in salt and pepper to taste. 

We recommend using fresh lemon and garlic. You can also add cumin or other spices to your hummus blend. Try playing with the amount of garlic, lemon juice, or tahini for varying flavour. 

**Pita**

Mix sourdough starter discard, water, oil, salt, baking powder, and flour (2 cups) in a bowl. Combine into a smooth dough, add flour if it's too sticky to work with. 

Knead dough for about 5 minutes, then place in lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. 

Divide dough into 6 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Press flat with your palms and then flatten using two flat surfaces (such as a cutting board and countertop). Cover flattened dough and leave to rest for 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat lightly oiled cast-iron over medium high. 

Cook dough on cast iron for about 30 seconds per side. 

Keep warm in 200Â°F oven until ready to serve, or store in fridge for up to a few days for later.

What's the draw to hummus and pita? For Erin, every time the word hummus comes up she's taken back to her brother's Bar Mitzvah year when the family visited Israel together for the first and only time. Our guide toured us around ancient sites and landmarks, but most memorably took us into beautiful culturally diverse areas accented by amazing local food. It was here we tasted the best hummus ever and learned the [correct pronunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PgQ3i0Fdo0). As soon as we were back in Canada, there was a trip to the local Greek market to pick up the most extravagant hummus we could find. It was good, but it was no Israel hummus.
