In a food processor or blender, combine chickpeas, lemon juice, crushed garlic cloves, and olive oil. Blend until smooth, adding olive oil as needed. Once smooth and combined, blend in salt and pepper to taste. 

We recommend using fresh lemon and garlic. You can also add cumin or other spices to your hummus blend. Try playing with the amount of garlic, lemon juice, or tahini for varying flavour.

What's the draw to hummus? For Erin, every time the word comes up she's taken back to her brother's Bar Mitzvah year when the family visited Israel together for the first and only time. Our guide toured us around ancient sites and landmarks, but most memorably took us into beautiful culturally diverse areas accented by amazing local food. It was here we tasted the best hummus ever and learned the [correct pronunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PgQ3i0Fdo0). As soon as we were back in Canada, there was a trip to the local Greek market to pick up the most extravagant hummus we could find. It was good, but it was no Israel hummus.
