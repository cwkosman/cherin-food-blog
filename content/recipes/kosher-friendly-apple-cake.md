Peel and slice apples. Remove any stems or seeds.

Preheat oven to 350**°**F and grease 9x13-inch baking pan.

In a medium bowl, beat 2 eggs, sugar (1 c) and vanilla until fluffy. Then beat in oil (1/2 c). Add water (3 Tbsp) to mixture.

In a large bowl, mix together flour (1 1/2 c), baking powder (2 tsp), and salt (1/4 tsp). Then add liquid ingredients to dry and beat until just smooth.

In a large bowl, toss apple slices with cinnamon (2 1/2 tsp) and sugar (1/2 c).

Spoon half of batter into baking pan. Spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Add apples, and cover them as much as possible with remaining batter.

Bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes, until nicely browned.

When you have a large family gathering, it's very difficult to accommodate everyone's dietary restrictions and still have the food taste good. But this dairy free cake ticks most of the boxes, and quickly became the widely requested dessert for Erin's grandmother and mom to bring to family dinners.

The ingredients are simple. If you have a tough time spreading the second half of the batter over the apples in the pan, don't worry, it means your batter is the correct consistency. You may also be worried you put too many apples in it, but you didn't, just make sure they are covered sufficiently in sugar.

We suggest using crisp, crunchy, sweet apples. But you can experiment with whichever types you like. Also try reserving the apple skins, to bake them into apple chips and minimize food waste.

This apple cake recipe is adapted from a copy of [Second Helpings, Please!](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/second-helpings-please/9781770503199-item.html) that has been passed through 3 generations of Jewish bakers. Erin carries on the tradition today, occasionally making this cake for family get-togethers.
