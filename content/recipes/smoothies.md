First, place rolled oats (1/4 cup) in blender and blend until powdered. Then add fruit, peanut butter, yogurt, milk, and optionally protein powder. Blend on high until smooth. 

Enjoy topped with hemp seeds after a workout, as an easy breakfast shake, or just a snack.

Sometimes you have time in the morning to cook a deluxe breakfast, and sometimes you have about 5 minutes before your day of meetings starts. On those busy days, Chuck and Erin like the simplicity of throwing together a delicious yet nutritious smoothie to kick-start the day.
