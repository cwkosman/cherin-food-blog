Pre-heat oven to 375Â°F

Lay a sheet of parchment paper, just over twice the width of your salmon filet. 

Thinly slice fennel bulb and place on one side of parchment paper. Put salmon filet, skin-side down, on top of fennel slices. 

Mix 1/2 tsp of sumac with 1/2 tsp of salt. Rub mix evenly over salmon filet. 

Top salmon with chopped sprigs of fennel. 

Fold parchment paper over arrangement and seal by incrementally folding the paper over itself.

Bake for 15-20 minutes, depending on thickness of filet.

We created this recipe while looking for low acid dinner options. Sumac is versatile spice that is often overlooked in North American cooking. The tang of this spice can be capitalized on as a substitute for lemon. 

[Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/salmon_with_fennel_baked_in_parchment/) shows a step-by-step breakdown of folding the salmon into the parchment packet. 

This dish pairs well with a side of cooked barley and steamed broccoli.
