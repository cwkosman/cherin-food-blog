Once done cooking, release the steam and set pot to saut√©. Shred jackfruit with a fork. Stir in noodles, lime juice, spinach, and basil and keep on heat for about 5 minutes, or until noodles are soft. 

Ladle soup into bowls, top with peanuts, and serve!

We love authentic ramen and Vancouver is full of delicious ramen joints. However, we also like casual, minimal preparation spin offs of our favourite dishes for busy nights. This is most certainly the latter.

This recipe came to us on and rainy Vancouver winter night. It was dark, damp, and flu season was in the air. We wanted a dinner that would warm the bones and chase away the first throat tickles of an oncoming cold. We found Halfbaked Harvest's [30 Minute Thai Peanut Chicken Ramen](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/20-minute-thai-peanut-chicken-ramen/).

Delightfully surprised such a simple, quick meal could taste this good, we're pleased to share it around with our adjustments. You could really use any protein for this, but we enjoy tofu and adding jackfruit for texture. Use a curry paste that meets your spice preference and dietary restrictions; we like using the Mae Ploy brand to bring the heat!
