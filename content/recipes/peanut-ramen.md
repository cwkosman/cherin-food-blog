In a pressure cooker bowl, combine broth (4 cups), coconut milk (14 oz), soy sauce (1/4 cup), fish sauce - optional (2 Tbsp), brown sugar (2 Tbsp), peanut butter (1/3 cup), and curry paste (1/4 cup). Add jackfruit, tofu, cremini mushrooms, red peppers, ginger and garlic. Cover and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes. 

Once done cooking, release the steam and set pot to saut√©. Shred jackfruit with a fork. Stir in noodles, lime juice, spinach, and basil for about 5 minutes, or until noodles are soft. 

Ladle soup into bowls, top with peanuts, and serve!

Let's caveat this post with: we love authentic ramen and are graced with the presence of delicious ramen restaurants all over Vancouver which we frequent often,  we also fully recognize that this recipe of ours is not that. 

This recipe came to us on and rainy Vancouver winter night. It was dark, damp, and flu season was in the air. We wanted a dinner that would warm the bones and chase away the ticklings of a cold. We found Halfbaked Harvest's [30 Minute Thai Peanut Chicken Ramen](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/20-minute-thai-peanut-chicken-ramen/). 

Delightfully surprised such a simple, quick meal could taste this good, we're pleased to share it around with our adjustments. You could really use any protein for this, but we enjoy tofu and adding jackfruit for texture. If you like spice, like us, you can always add more curry paste or use a particular brand (we prefer using Mae Ploy Green Curry Paste).
