      componentTitle: Toppings

Set aside wet ingredients to bring up to room temperature (eggs, beer, oil) and plug in waffle iron to heat up. We use [Cuisinart waffle maker](https://www.cuisinart.com/shopping/appliances/waffle_makers/waf-300) set to level 3. 

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour (1 3/4 cup), cornmeal (2/3 cup), salt (1/2 Tsp.), sugar (1 Tbsp.), and baking powder (1 Tbsp.). 

Coarsely grate about 1 cup of cheddar cheese, and set aside. 

In a separate bowl, combine beer (2 cup), eggs (2), and oil (1/4 cup) and thoroughly mix. The beer will cause the mixture to foam up. 

Add wet ingredients to dry mix until the batter is runny but not fully liquid, it should be a consistency that allows it to spread once ladled onto waffle iron but not completely evenly. Fold in cheese (1 cup) to batter. 

Once waffle iron is up to temperature, pour about 1 cup of waffle mixture (depending on the size of your waffle iron) onto iron and spread batter so it just about covers all surfaces. We like to use 2 scoops of a soup ladle, this mix makes 3 batches in our waffle maker. 

Turn oven to 200°F to keep cooked waffles warm ahead of serving. 

While round 1 of waffles cook, prepare your toppings. 

Heat up oil to med-high in skillet (1 Tbsp.), add onions and cook until they are slightly transparent. Then add sliced mushrooms and cook until browned around the edges. Reduce heat to low. When waffles are just about ready to be served, turn heat back up to medium and toss in torn bitter greens and salt and pepper to taste. Mix and cook for 2-3 minutes then top waffles.
