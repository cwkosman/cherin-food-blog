Heat Xx water in a large pot over high. Add salt (3 Tbsp) to water and cover with lid

Prep bacon (4 oz), cheese (2 oz), 

Separate 4 egg yolks and set aside egg whites for future use. Whisk egg yolks with 2 eggs until fully mixed. Stir in 3/4 of grated cheese and about 1/2 tsp of pepper

In a saucepan, heat oil (2 Tbsp) and add bacon. Cook until crisped around the edges, 7-10 minutes depending on the thickness of your bacon. 

Remove bacon from saucepan 

Cook pasta (1 lb) in boiling water, set timer for 2 minutes under the package instructions as you'll be cooking the pasta longer later.
