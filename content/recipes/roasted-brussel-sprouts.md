Heat 1 Tbsp coconut oil in pan.

Preheat oven to 400 deg C and prepare baking sheet with parchment paper.

Thinly slice mushrooms and onion in strips. Generously salt mushrooms and onions in frying pan. Fry until onion is lightly browned and mushrooms are more thoroughly browned. 

Trim ends of brussel sprouts and cut in half. 

Place brussel sprouts on baking sheet, top with the pan-fried mushrooms and onion mix and remaining coconut oil (melted). Mix together and spread out on baking sheet. 

Bake in oven for 15-20 minutes, until brussel sprouts start to brown.
