In first year of university, Erin lived on residence, and spent many-a meal plan flex-dollars at "The Lazy Scholar" - the snack bar in the basement of the Victoria Hall residence building. One of the all-time favourites were the chicken snack wraps. Chicken strips inside a wrap with mayo, hot sauce, and lettuce. These snack wraps are an ode to those freshman days, irregular mealtimes squeezed between classes and sports practice, and late night eats after a kegger or two.
