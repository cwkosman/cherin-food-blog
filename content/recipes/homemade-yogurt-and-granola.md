**Plain Yogurt**\
\
Add milk to Instant Pot. Click the "yogurt" function until the display reads "Boil". Wait for the Instant Pot to finish the boiling cycle. If using a thermometer, make sure the milk has reached at least 180 °F.\
\
Remove the inner pot from the Instant Pot. Allow the milk to cool down at room temperature, lid off, to 110 - 115 °F.\
\
Skin off any "skin" that has developed on to top of the milk. Whisk in the yogurt until completely dissolved in the milk. Return inner pot to the Instant Pot.\
\
Hit the yogurt button twice until a timer display for 8 hours appears. Cover to let the bacteria propagate for the duration.\
\
Mix yogurt thoroughly to ensure consistency. Optionally, strain the yogurt overnight in the refrigerator using cheesecloth in a strainer set above a large bowl for thicker yogurt. Transfer to containers and store in the fridge or freezer until ready to use.

**Granola**\
\
Preheat oven to 350 °F.\
\
Mix oats, nuts, salt, and cinnamon together in a large mixing bowl.\
\
Melt honey and coconut oil together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Pour the melted honey and coconut oil over the dry ingredients. Add vanilla extract and stir to combine.\
\
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the granola mixture evenly over the baking sheet, using the back of a wooden spoon to evenly flatten. Bake for 20 - 24 minutes, turning over the granola halfway through baking and patting down with a wooden spoon. Let cool for 45 minutes, the granola will harden.\
\
Break the granola into the desired size and store in airtight containers at room temperature. Optionally, add in coconut flakes and chocolate chips for extra sweetness.
