**Crepe Batter** 

Mix the crepe batter ingredients (1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup milk, 1 cup sourdough discard, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 eggs) together in a blender. Blend until batter is smooth and fully combined. The batter should yield 2 full cups. 

Set batter aside and let rest for 5-10 minutes. 

**Making the Crepes**

Heat a good non-stick pan over medium heat. With a paper towel, grease the pan by evenly applying a thin coating of coconut oil over the surface - be careful not to burn yourself on the hot pan. Keep the towel for later to re-apply oil as needed. 

Pour about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of batter (depending on the size of your pan) into the pan - you'll figure out the optimum amount of batter as you go. Immediately but carefully 'swirl' the pan by the handle to allow the batter to flow evenly around the bottom of the pan. This should give you a thin, round coating over the entire bottom of the pan. 

Let the batter cook undisturbed until the top side is almost dry to the touch and very lightly browned on the bottom, roughly 1-2 minutes. 

With a rubber spatula, loosen the edges of the crepe. Slip the spatula under the crepe and grip the edge with your other hand (again be careful not to burn yourself) and flip the crepe fully onto the other side. You should *definitely* be able to do this *absolutely* perfectly the first time. 

The second side should cook for 30-60 seconds. Then remove by loosening the sides with a rubber spatula and sliding the crepe onto a plate. 

Rinse and repeat. 

Once all the crepes are made, they can be rolled, folded, filled and/or topped to your heart's content. 

INSERT STORY SOMETHING sourdough starter or cafe crepe esque

The first time we tried this, we fried tomatoes and swiss chard while making the crepes. Placing the tomatoes, greens, and cheddar cheese slices in a line down the center of the crepes, rolled them up, and topped with balsamic reduction. We left them rolled and on a pan at low heat until all the crepes were done and ready to be eaten together. 

We've also tried these savoury crepes with simple chocolate-hazelnut spread and found they were the right amount of sweet, but you can try adding sugar to the batter as well. 

We'd like to thank 'Butter for All' for their simple and excellent [Soft and Chewy Sourdough Crepes](https://www.butterforall.com/traditional-cooking-traditional-living/soft-and-chewy-sourdough-crepes/) recipe. There are lots of other more complicated and untried by us recipes on the internet, but who has time for that?
